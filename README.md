#Tumblr Filter#

This Google Chrome extension filters a Tumblr Dashboard by post type:

Posts can be filtered by text, photo, quote, link, chat, audio, ask
and video. By just the click of a button the user can choose what post
type they want to see (Greyed out button means that post type wont be
shown) and this post type will be hidden.


## Future Updates ##

- Automatically look for new content when none is found.
- Filtering of single tumblr blogs.


##Functionality##

Uses JQuery and Javascript to read the div elements that contain the class
of a certain post type and hides it.
